### Grading

All grading happens on [the grading server](https://stat-301-instructor.stat.ubc.ca). If 
you visit that URL in your browser, you will be taken to a login page.

You can log into your individual account using your username and password. You can do whatever 
you want in this account; this is your "sandbox." It's often useful to clone our 

You can *also* log into a *grading account* (usually something like `worksheet-grader-0`)
using the *grading account's username* and *your usual password*.
DSCIBot will email you when you are given a grading task to work on.

### How to login to grading server
1. Access the instructor server at stat-301-instructor.stat.ubc.ca
2. The grader login is not your regular login it is composed of two parts: 
stat301 + name of assignment + your grading account username
For example, my login is gaby, then to grade tutorial_01 I’ll enter as my login:
   stat301tutorial_01gaby
3.  After sucessfully logging in your page should look like this

### Important note about grading

There is no "submit" button when you finish grading.
The grading system considers your job to be "done" when
you complete grading all students.

**So if you are not ready yet (still want to look things over,
discuss with another TA, etc) make
sure not to grade all of your students. Leave at least one ungraded.**

When you are finally ready to be "finished," you can grade
all of the students and the system will automatically continue
the grading/return/feedback process.
